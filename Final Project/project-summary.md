# Blk.Film Project

## Project Summary

The Blk.Film project is a minimalistic and responsive website designed to showcase the mission and works of Blk.Film. The project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with Tailwind CSS for additional styling. The design choices and methodologies used in this project are aimed at creating a clean, efficient, and accessible user experience.

## Design Choices

### Minimalistic Design
The website features a minimalistic design, focusing on simplicity and ease of navigation. The layout is clean, with ample white space to ensure content is easily readable and visually appealing.

### Styling
- **CSS**: Used for the foundational structure and layout of the website.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utilized for font and typography styling, as well as for responsive design breakpoints.
- **Button Animations**: Handled with regular CSS to create smooth hover effects and transitions.

### Methodologies
- **BEM (Block Element Modifier)**: Employed for HTML class naming to ensure a clear and maintainable structure.
- **OOCSS (Object-Oriented CSS)**: Used to separate structure and skin, making the CSS more modular and reusable.

### Performance Optimization
- **Minimized Styles**: CSS files have been minimized to reduce load times.
- **WebP Images**: Images have been converted to the WebP format for better performance and faster loading.

### Interactive Elements
- **Scroll Animation**: Implemented using CSS keyframes and JavaScript to create dynamic visual effects as users scroll through the page.
- **Header and Footer Toggles**: JavaScript is used to handle the toggling of the header and footer for a more interactive user experience.

### Compatibility and Responsiveness
The website has been tested for compatibility across various browsers and devices. It is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience on mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.

## Accessibility
Efforts have been made to ensure the website is accessible to all users, including those using screen readers and keyboard navigation. ARIA labels and semantic HTML have been used to enhance accessibility.
